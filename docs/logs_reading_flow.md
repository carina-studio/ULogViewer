# How Does ULogViewer Read and Parse Logs
In order to read and parse various type of logs, there is a special flow of reading and parsing logs in ULogViewer you may need to know before defining your own log profile.

## Parts Included in Reading and Parsing Logs
### Underlying Log Data
This is the original source which provides raw log data outside from ULogViewer. It may be a file, a database or output of another program.

### Log Data Source
This is the first part of ULogViewer to read raw log data into ULogViewer. 
There are various type of ```Log Data Source``` in ULogViewer to handle different type of ```Underlying Log Data```.

```Log Data Source``` reads raw log data and transforms into multiple ```Raw Log Line``` which is represented as string no matter what type of raw log data is.
It is important to know what ```Raw Log Line``` will be generated by specific ```Log Data Source``` so that you can define how to parse these ```Raw Log Line``` into actual logs.

### Log Profile
There are lots of information in ```Log Profile``` and part of them are related to logs parsing. For ex, log patterns, timestamp format, etc.

### Log Reader
Takes ```Raw Log Line``` generated by ```Log Data Source``` then parse and convert to actual logs according to information provided by ```Log Profile```.


## Log Data Sources
### File
```File Log Data Source``` is the simplest type of ```Log Data Source``` which reads strings line by line from file directly. You can specify what encoding is used to read strings from file.

### Standard Output (stdout)
Launches a specific program and reads strings line by line in ```UTF-8``` from the standard output (stdout) of the program. 
You need to define the ```Command``` first in order to launch program and pass parameters. For ex, ```ipconfig /all``` (on Windows).
Further more, you can define extra commands which will be executed **BEFORE** or **AFTER** reading raw log data.

### HTTP/HTTPS
Sends HTTP/HTTPS request to specific URI and reads the response line by line. You can provide ```User Name``` and ```Password``` if login is needed for sending request.

### TCP Server
Create a TCP server which binds to specific IP/Port then read text content from client once client connect to the bound IP/Port.

### UDP Server
Create a UDP server which binds to specific IP/Port and read text once data sent to the bound IP/Port.

### SQLite
Performs specific ```Query String``` (SQL command) and gets the result rows back. Because database result is not a set of strings, ```SQLite Log Data Source``` will transform the result into strings **COLUMN by COLUMN** and **ROW by ROW**. For ex, if the result is

Column1 | Column2 | Column3
--------|---------|--------
A       |B        |C
D       |E        |F

Then the transformation order will be:
1. A
2. B
3. C
4. D
5. E
6. F

For each column, ```SQLite Log Data Source``` will transform data to string according to the value type of column:

- If the type is ```String```, it will transform data into 3 or more lines:
  ```xml
  <ColumnName>
  Value encoded as XML string
  </ColumnName>
  ```
  
- If the type is ```Blob```, it will encode data to Base64 string and transform into 1 line:
  ```xml
  <ColumnName>Base64 encoded data</ColumnName>
  ```
  
- If the type is ```Timestamp```, it will transform into 1 line:
  ```xml
  <ColumnName>Timestamp whth format yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.ffffff</ColumnName>
  ```
  
- For other types, it will transform into 1 line:
  ```xml
  <ColumnName>Value</ColumnName>
  ```

Lets see a pratical example, if the database result is:

ID | Timestamp | Message
---|-----------|--------
1  | 1/1 10:08 | First message
2  | 1/1 10:09 | &lt;Second message&gt;

Then ```SQLite Log Data Source``` will generate the following 10 ```Raw Log Line```:

```xml
<ID>1</ID>
<Timestamp>2021/1/1 10:08:00.000000</Timestamp>
<Message>
First message
</Message>
<ID>2</ID>
<Timestamp>2021/1/1 10:09:00.000000</Timestamp>
<Message>
&lt;Second message&gt;
</Message>
```

### Windows Event Logs (Windows only)
Gets structured Windows Event Logs data from system and transform each Event Log to strings in the following format:

```xml
<Timestamp>Timestamp of log in yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss format</Timestamp>
<EventId>Event ID</EventId>
<Level>Level character</Level>
<Source>Source of log encoded as XML string</Source>
<Message>
Message of log encoded as XML string
</Message>
```

For ```Level character```, please refer to the following table:

Character | Level
----------|------
e         |Error
f         |Failure
i         |Info
s         |Success
w         |Warn


## Parsing Information Defined in Log Profile
### Log Patterns
After knowing what ```Raw Log Line``` will be generated by ```Log Data Source```, you need to define ```Log Pattern``` to parse and extract information from ```Raw Log Line```.

Each ```Log Pattern``` is defined for specific single ```Raw Log Line```. 
If each log can be generated from single ```Raw Log Line``` then you just need one ```Log Pattern```.
If each log may generated by more than one ```Raw Log Line``` then you need to define multiple ```Log Pattern``` for each type of ```Raw Log Line``` in single log.

For example:
- If each log will be generated by ```Raw Log Line (Type 1)``` then you just need to define a ```Log Pattern``` for ```Raw Log Line (Type 1)```.
- If each log will be generated by 3 type of ```Raw Log Line```:
  - ```Raw Log Line (Type 1)```
  - ```Raw Log Line (Type 2)```
  - ```Raw Log Line (Type 3)```
  
  Then you need to define 3 ```Log Pattern```
  - ```Log Pattern 1``` for ```Raw Log Line (Type 1)```
  - ```Log Pattern 2``` for ```Raw Log Line (Type 2)```
  - ```Log Pattern 3``` for ```Raw Log Line (Type 3)```

> Note: Starting from 0.17.0.812, If there is no ```Log Pattern``` defined then ```Raw Log Line``` will be treat as ```Message``` of log directly. Therefore, you can see ```Raw Log Line``` in viewer by skipping defining ```Log Patterns```.

There are 3 parameters in each ```Log Pattern```:
#### Pattern
  Decribe the string pattern of ```Raw Log Line``` by [**Regular Expression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). Further more, you need to use [**Grouping Syntax/Construct**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference#grouping-constructs) to extract data from ```Raw Log Line``` for specific property of log. 
  There is a specific button in Log Pattern dialog which helps you to insert **Grouping Syntax** easily for specific log property.
  
  Please refer to [**here**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference) for complete reference of Regular Expression.

#### Is Repeatable
If the specifc type of ```Raw Log Line``` may occurrs more than one times continuously, then you can mark the ```Log Pattern``` as repeatable.

#### Is Skippable
If the specifc type of ```Raw Log Line``` may not occurr, then you can mark the ```Log Pattern``` as skippable.
Usually you need to take both **Is Repeatable** and **Is Skippable** into account according to the following conditions:

Cases             | Repeatable = False | Repeatable = True
------------------|--------------------|------------------
Skippable = False | ```Raw Log Line``` should occur exact 1 time   | ```Raw Log Line``` should occur at least 1 time continuously
Skippable = True  | ```Raw Log Line``` should occur at most 1 time | ```Raw Log Line``` should not occur or occur continuously

### Log Level Map
If information of ```Level``` of log has been extracted from ```Raw Log Line``` by ```Log Pattern```, we need a table to describe how to convert from ```String``` to ```Level``` of log. If the table doesn't exist, ```Level``` of log will be ```Undefined```.

For example, if valid set of ```Level``` of log is ```{ Success, Failure }``` and you know that 'S' means ```Success``` and 'F' means ```Failure``` in ``` Raw Log Line```, then you need to provide the following ```Log Level Map```:

Text | Mapped Level
-----|-------------
F    | Failure
S    | Success

### Log String Encoding
Consider the format of ```Raw Log Line```, the data in ```Raw Log Line``` may be encoded in specific way to prevent conflict with the format. 
For example, ```Raw Log Line``` generated by ```SQLite Log Data Source``` is XML-like format, so the value inside ```Raw Log Line``` will be encoded as XML/HTML string.

### Timestamp type
There are 4 type of timestamp supported for parsing timestamp from ```Raw Log Line```:
* Unix Timestamp in seconds. Seconds with decimal place is supported.
* Unix Timestamp in milliseconds. Milliseconds with decimal place is supported.
* Unix Timestamp in microseconds. Microseconds with decimal place is supported.
* Custom.

### Timestamp format
The format of timestamp of log extracted from ```Raw Log Line``` varies between different type of logs. If you found that ULogViewer cannot parse the timestamp correctly by default way, you can set ```Timestamp type``` to ```Custom``` and provide the exact format to parse timestamp correctly.

Please refer to [**here**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings) for complete reference of date time format.

### Time span type
Sometimes the time in ```Raw Log Line``` are represented in "Relative time" instead of exact timestamp. In this case you can extract and parse time from ```Raw Log Line``` as ```Time span```. There are 7 type of time span supported:
* Total days. For ex, ```1.5 days``` which means 1 day and 12 hours.
* Total hours. For ex, ```20.5 hours``` which means 20 hours and 30 minutes.
* Total minutes.
* Total seconds.
* Total milliseconds.
* Total microseconds.
* Custom.

### Time span format
Just like ```Timestamp format```, you can set ```Time span type``` to ```Custom``` and provide the exact format to parse time span correctly.

Please refer to [**here**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-timespan-format-strings) for complete reference of time span format.
